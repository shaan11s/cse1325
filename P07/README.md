# Support Code for Exceptional Laptops and Supercomputers Always (ELSA)

This baseline includes the Java code to implement the ELSA Store class, as well as a TestStore.java regression test.

**This code will NOT compile until paired with your own Customer, Option, Computer, and Order classes!** See the class diagram in the requirements document for details.

The intent is for you to copy these files to your own repository to test your code AFTER it has been written.
