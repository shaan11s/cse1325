HOMEWORK P12 RESULTS
====================

Spring 2023

NOTE: We will not be grading for "correct" answers, since your results may vary, but rather answers that are consistent with your measured results.

IMPORTANT: If at all possible, time your program on a machine with at least 4 cores. (CSE VM may be configured to use multiple cores in the VirtualBox properties panel.)

FULL CREDIT
===========

QUESTION 1: Which puzzle did you use as ThreadsOfSudoku's parameter to achieve a 30+ second runtime (using "real"): 14_zeros

QUESTION 2: Provide the full ``time`` output for your program, with 1 to 16 threads. It may prove interesting to screenshot your system monitor while these run. You may be able to run all of these with a single bash command if you like (replace 14_zeros with your puzzle from QUESTION 1): 

for i in {1..16} ; do printf "\n Threads %d:\n" $i ; time (java ThreadsOfSudoku $i puzzle.txt 14_zeros > temp.txt) ; done

Example Timing (first 2 of 16 runs only on Antares):

ricegf@antares$ for i in {1..16} ; do printf "\n Threads %d:\n" $i ; time (java ThreadsOfSudoku $i puzzle.txt 14_zeros > temp.txt) ; done

 Threads 1:

real	2m0.684s
user	2m0.919s
sys	0m0.292s

 Threads 2:

real	1m4.553s
user	2m7.003s
sys	0m0.252s



YOUR Timing:
java ThreadsOfSudoku 2 puzzle.txt 14_zeros  105.60s user 0.33s system 185% cpu 57.038 total (2 threads)

java ThreadsOfSudoku 1 puzzle.txt 14_zeros  101.28s user 0.75s system 100% cpu 1:41.73 total (1 thread)



QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program slightly?  Why or why not?
SPEEDS IT UP. Because threads run concurrently! 




QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load", or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
YES, because each additional thread uses additional resources. 




BONUS
=====

QUESTION 5: Time your thread pool version of ThreadsOfSudoku as you did for the full credit version. Post your timings here.

YOUR Timing:






QUESTION 6: Is a thread pool faster, slower, or roughly equivalent in performance? 



QUESTION 7: Compare the full credit and bonus solution code. Which do you believe is more supportable over a long lifetime of evolving hardware and environments?
